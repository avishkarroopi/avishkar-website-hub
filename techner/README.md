# Techner — Static Page

This folder contains a standalone, production-ready static page for Techner (`/techner/index.html`).

Setup

1. Serve the folder with any static server. Example (Python):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open `http://localhost:8000/techner/` or `http://localhost:8000/techner/index.html`.

Notes

- Update the `mailto:` address in `script.js` or the contact form to your real contact email.
- The design is dark, developer-focused, and responsive. Replace copy and assets as needed.
